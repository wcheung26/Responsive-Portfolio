			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<p>Originally from Hong Kong, I've lived in the San Francisco Bay Area for 5 years since attending UC Berkeley in 2012. At UCB, I studied Business Administration and went on to pursue a career in finance. However, I found myself more passionate about entrepreneurship and technology. After taking an introductory Computer Science class at UCB, I've been creating mini coding projects in my spare time. I've done introductory work in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python.

			<p>
			I'm a fan of both outdoor and indoor activities, as long as it doesn't involve intense swimming (I dreaded swimming in PE class). I like outdoor activities like mountain biking, surfing, skateboarding, and soccer. For indoors, I like to play pool/snooker, darts, and am currently picking up board games with friends.
